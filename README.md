# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
A client on the Colorado Board of Elections, in order to certify the election, hired us to perform an audit of a recent local congressional election. They wanted to know the following things:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
3. Which county had the largest number of votes?
4. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
5. The total number of votes on each candidate received.
6. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
7. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
